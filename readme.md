**This repository contains code to verify the results of paper [_High-resolution structure prediction of β-barrel membrane proteins_](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/7/1511.short)**

To predict noval β-barrel membrane proteins, please contact [Hammad Naveed](mailto:ammadnaveed@yahoo.com) or [Jie Liang](mailto:jliang@uic.edu)



bb-reg contains the programs and input data that are used to predict strand registers of beta barrel membrane proteins.

bb-barrel contains the programs to construct 3d structure from the bb-reg results.

Usage:

>	python main.py

>	in each folder to run and check the results
